# Harmonic\_Balance\_Learn

This repository contains a simplified source code implementation of the **Harmonic Balance Method** for nonlinear vibrations. The code is a stripped-down version of **NL-Vib**, tailored specifically for educational purposes. Extensive comments are provided throughout the code to enhance understanding of the implementation process.

## Overview

* **System**: Two-degree-of-freedom system
* **Method**: Harmonic Balance
* **Inspiration**: Based on the NL-Vib toolbox, with significant simplifications
* **Purpose**: Educational – to assist in learning how to code the Harmonic Balance method

## Key Modifications from NL-Vib

* Only a single predictor method and one corrector method are included
* All other options from NL-Vib have been removed for simplicity
* Functions have been edited and simplified for clarity
* Designed for a specific example taken from the reference book

## Reference

This implementation follows an example from the book:
