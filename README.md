# Harmonic_Balance_Learn
This is a source code for harmonic balance. The code is a strip down version of NL-Vib. Extensive comments are given for better understanding the coding procedure.  




Two degree of freedom system Harmonic balance basic code
The code is heavily inspired from NL-Vib. Functions are edited and copied from NL-Vib, the modification removed many options. This code provide only single options. 
There is only on predictor method and one corrector method.
The example used is also from the Book : Harmonic balance mehod for nonlinear vibrations.
Aim of this code is to assist in learning coding Harmonic balance method.
